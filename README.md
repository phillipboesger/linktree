## Overview

This repository is the canonical source for `boesger.com`: a fully static, multi-page site with no build system, no package manager, and no JavaScript framework. Every page is hand-authored HTML, styled by a single shared CSS file, and enhanced by a small amount of vanilla JS (navigation, reveal-on-scroll, tabs, modals, carousel). There is nothing to install and nothing to compile — clone it, open a page in a browser, and it renders exactly as it will in production.

Other Bösger properties (`digital.boesger.com`, `polarion.boesger.com`, `colors.boesger.com`, `photography.boesger.com`, product subdomains such as `polarion-mcp.boesger.com`) are separate deployments and are not managed from this repository; they are linked from here as external references.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5 / CSS3** — hand-authored, no templating engine.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — no framework, no bundler, no transpilation step.
- **GitHub Pages** — static hosting, deployed automatically on every push to `main`.
- **Cloudflare** — DNS and CDN in front of the custom domain, including a small edge Worker (see `cloudflare/tools-proxy/`) that reverse-proxies select product subdomains under `boesger.com/tools/<slug>`.

## Local Development

No build step is required.

- Open any `.html` file directly in a browser, or
- Serve the folder with any static file server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server`.

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/updateWebsite.yml`, which publishes the repository contents to GitHub Pages. The custom domain (`boesger.com`) and DNS/CDN are configured through Cloudflare and the repository's Pages settings.

`style.css`, `site.js`, and `network.js` are cached for 4 hours at the edge (and by browsers). Each HTML page references them with a shared `?v=YYYYMMDDx` cache-busting query string — bump that string across every page when any of those three files change, so visitors don't get new markup paired with stale styles or scripts.

## Customization

For the full architecture reference, design-token table, and copy-paste patterns for links, work cards, section headings, tabs, and the media carousel, see [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md).
